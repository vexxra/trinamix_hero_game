A small project for the following task:

Task:

Please implement the following game in C# or JavaScript. The code (and, if you choose, docs and/or tests) should meet your professional standards, as if it were a task at work. If possible, do not try to guess what kind of code we "want to see", just solve the problem as you think best. Also, don't spend any time on a nice user experience -- ugly is ok, and you don't need more features than the ones given below (in particular, overlapping output and input messages on the console are allowed). Use any libraries you like. Spend up to four hours; if it would take you much longer, stop and instead write a brief explanation of your plan for the rest (in comments or a separate freeform text).

The player controls a hero who fights two monsters: an orc and a dragon.

The hero has 40 health points, the orc has 7, the dragon has 20.

Every 1500ms, the orc attacks the hero for 1 damage, which means that the hero loses 1 health point.

Every 2000ms, the dragon attacks the hero for 3 damage.

Each time the player types "attack orc" or "attack dragon", the hero attacks the corresponding monster for 2 damage.

If the orc's or dragon's health points are reduced to zero, it is dead and can neither attack nor be attacked.

If both monsters die, the player wins the game.

If the hero's health points are reduced to zero, the player loses the game.

Display text messages on the console to keep the player informed when something happens, e.g. "Hero hits orc. Orc health is 3". Don't include a GUI.




The project can be run as 

node src/main.js 

in a console. Console events from monster events overlap with the user input, but as long as "attack orc" or "attack dragon" was written in sequence before hitting enter, the hero will attack.
